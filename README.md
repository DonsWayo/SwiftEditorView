Sourceful is a syntax text editor for iOS and macOS, providing subclasses of `UITextView` and `NSTextView` that offer live syntax highlighting as you type. Right now it includes syntax highlighting support for Swift and Python, but it's easy to add your own.

This project is a combination of two projects from Louis Dâ€™hauwe: [SavannaKit](https://github.com/louisdh/savannakit) and [Source Editor](https://github.com/louisdh/source-editor).
